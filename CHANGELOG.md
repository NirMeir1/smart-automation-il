# Changelog

- Centered all content using a shared container and renamed design tokens to new theme variables.
- Expanded the home page with process, proof, case studies, and FAQ sections for clearer flow and added a final CTA block.
- Replaced the floating CTA with a fixed bottom contact dock to keep contact options accessible without covering content.
